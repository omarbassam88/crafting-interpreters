# Cafting interpreters

This repository is a follow along for the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) book. It implements an interpreter and a compiler for the Lox programming language using Java and C programming languages.

## Requirements

- GNU Make
- Java

## Building

### jlox

To build jlox class files run the following command

``` shell
make jlox
```

## Usage

### jlox

Running the `jlox` command without any arguments enters you in an interactive REPL. Alternatively, you can run a file by passing it as an argument to jlox:

``` shell
jlox <file>
```
